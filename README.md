# Tah-Do

## About Tah-Do
Tah-Do is a todo list with a difference. Tah-Do helps you prioritise your items with impact vs effort.

### How to use
* Type your item in to the box provided. When adding each item, also specify the effort each item will take to complete along with the impact each item will have.
* Click "Add".
* Keep adding all your items. When you are ready to prioritise the list, click "Prioritise".
* Start working through your items, starting at the top of the list.
* To remove an item, click the red "X" to the right of it.
* Keep adding and removing items to your heart's content. After the first time you've loaded the page, it even works offline.

### Troubleshooting
* **The "Prioritise" button isn't showing**: The "Prioritise" button only shows when your list is not in priority order.
